goal: Consolidate skills into packages/kundera-ts/docs with automated symlink setup
now: Implement getContract() reference pattern using exported type utilities
test: pnpm docs:setup && pnpm --filter kundera-ts test:skills

done_this_session:
  - task: Moved all skill .mdx docs from docs/typescript/skills/ to packages/kundera-ts/docs/skills/
    files: [packages/kundera-ts/docs/skills/*.mdx]
  - task: Moved skill implementations from examples/skills/*/index.ts to packages/kundera-ts/docs/skills/*.ts
    files: [packages/kundera-ts/docs/skills/*.ts]
  - task: Removed duplicate test files from docs/typescript/skills/
    files: []
  - task: Created symlink docs/typescript/skills → ../../packages/kundera-ts/docs/skills
    files: [docs/typescript/skills]
  - task: Created scripts/setup-docs.ts for automated symlink creation and page discovery
    files: [scripts/setup-docs.ts]
  - task: Updated docs commands to run setup automatically (docs:dev, docs:build, docs:generate)
    files: [package.json]
  - task: Documented symlink pattern and setup workflow in CLAUDE.md
    files: [CLAUDE.md]

blockers: []

questions: []

decisions:
  - symlink_pattern: "Mintlify can't reference paths outside docs/ - symlink is cleanest solution"
  - no_copies: "User explicitly wanted no file duplication - symlink only"
  - auto_setup: "docs:dev/build/generate all run setup-docs.ts first to ensure symlinks exist"

findings:
  - "Mintlify docs.json paths must be inside docs/ - ../packages/... paths don't work"
  - "Git commits symlinks as mode 120000 - preserves the link across clones"
  - "setup-docs.ts also discovers new pages and updates docs.json navigation automatically"

worked:
  - "Symlink with relative path from link location: ../../packages/kundera-ts/docs/skills"
  - "PACKAGE_DOC_SOURCES config in setup-docs.ts for adding new package doc sources"

failed:
  - "Direct ../packages/... paths in docs.json - Mintlify doesn't follow parent traversal"

next:
  - "Implement reference getContract() pattern using FunctionRet type utilities"
  - "Split crypto/account-hash.ts into one-function-per-file per codebase standards"
  - "Document when .ts vs .js is acceptable (native/wasm backends)"

files:
  created:
    - scripts/setup-docs.ts
    - docs/typescript/skills (symlink)
    - packages/kundera-ts/docs/skills/*.ts (12 skill implementations)
  modified:
    - package.json
    - docs/docs.json
    - CLAUDE.md
    - packages/kundera-ts/docs/skills/*.mdx (updated copy commands)
