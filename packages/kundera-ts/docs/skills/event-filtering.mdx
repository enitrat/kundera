title: "Event Filtering"
description: "Decode and filter receipt events with ABI metadata."
---

This skill provides `decodeEvents`, `decodeEventsStrict`, and `compileEventFilter` helpers.
Copy it into your project and tailor filtering logic as needed.

## Quick Start

```bash
cp -r examples/skills/event-filtering src/skills/
```

## Usage

```ts
import { decodeEvents } from './skills/event-filtering';

const { result } = decodeEvents(receipt, abi, {
  event: 'Transfer',
  args: { from: [addr1, addr2], to: addr3 },
  address: contractAddress,
});
```

## Notes

- `decodeEvents` skips unknown events.
- `decodeEventsStrict` returns an error on the first unknown event.
- `compileEventFilter` builds raw key filters for reuse.
