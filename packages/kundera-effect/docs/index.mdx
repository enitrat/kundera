description: Wallet-first Effect services for Starknet
---

`@kundera-sn/kundera-effect` has been reset and rebuilt around a wallet-provider-first architecture.

Primary modules:

- `services`: Layer-based services for transport, provider, wallet, signer, contract and transactions
- `jsonrpc`: free functions for read operations
- `primitives`: schema-first input decoding helpers (`decode*`, `*.Hex` schemas)
- `presets`: ready-to-use provider and wallet stack presets
- request policy helpers are fiber-local and Effect-native (`withTimeout`, `withRetrySchedule`, `withTracing`)

Strict API guarantees:

- batch methods are required across transport and provider services
- wallet account requests use `silent_mode` (legacy `silentMode` alias removed)
- batch execution no longer falls back to sequential provider calls
