description: Wallet-first Effect services for Starknet
---

`@kundera-sn/kundera-effect` has been reset and rebuilt around a wallet-provider-first architecture.

Primary modules:

- `services`: Layer-based services for transport, provider, wallet, signer, contract and transactions
- `jsonrpc`: free functions for read operations
- `primitives`: schema-first input decoding helpers (`decode*`, `*.Hex` schemas)
- `presets`: ready-to-use provider and wallet stack presets
