title: Branded Types
description: Why Kundera uses branded types for felts, addresses, and hashes.
---

Kundera uses **branded types** to distinguish between values that share the same underlying representation but have different semantic meanings. A `ContractAddress` and a `ClassHash` are both 252-bit field elements, but they serve different purposes—branded types make these distinctions visible at compile time.

## The Pattern

```typescript
import { Felt, ContractAddress, ClassHash } from 'kundera';

// Create branded values
const felt = Felt.from('0x123');
const address = ContractAddress.from('0x456');
const classHash = ClassHash.from('0x789');

// TypeScript prevents mixing them
function deployContract(address: ContractAddress, classHash: ClassHash) { ... }

deployContract(address, classHash);  // OK
deployContract(classHash, address);  // Type error!
deployContract(felt, felt);          // Type error!
```

## Why Branded Types?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Compile-Time Safety** | Catch address/hash mixups before runtime |
| **Self-Documenting** | Function signatures clearly show what's expected |
| **IDE Support** | Autocomplete and hover docs work correctly |
| **Zero Runtime Cost** | Brands exist only at compile time |

<Warning>
## Conversion Required for External Data

When receiving data from external sources (RPC responses, user input), you must explicitly convert to branded types:

```typescript
// RPC returns raw hex strings
const rawAddress = '0x049d36570d4e46f48e99674bd3fcc84644ddd6b96f7c741b1562b82f9e004dc7';

// Explicit conversion required
const address = ContractAddress.from(rawAddress);
```

Never assume external data is already branded—always use the `.from()` constructor.
</Warning>

## Available Branded Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `Felt` | Raw 252-bit field element | `Felt.from('0x123')` |
| `ContractAddress` | Contract address | `ContractAddress.from('0x456')` |
| `ClassHash` | Contract class hash | `ClassHash.from('0x789')` |
| `EntryPointSelector` | Function selector | `EntryPointSelector.from('transfer')` |
| `TransactionHash` | Transaction hash | `TransactionHash.from('0xabc')` |
