title: "HTTP Provider"
description: "Lightweight JSON-RPC provider built on transports + rpc methods."
---

This skill creates a minimal HTTP provider that wraps `kundera/transport` and `kundera/rpc`.
Copy it into your project and tailor the method surface to your needs.

## Quick Start

```bash
cp -r examples/skills/http-provider src/skills/
```

## Usage

```ts
import { createHttpProvider } from './skills/http-provider';

const provider = createHttpProvider({
  url: 'https://starknet-mainnet.public.blastapi.io',
});

const chainId = await provider.chainId();
const block = await provider.blockNumber();
```

## Notes

- Methods are thin wrappers around `kundera/rpc`.
- Add/remove methods to match your app's needs.
- `provider.transport` exposes the low-level transport for custom calls.
- For batching/retries, use the `http-transport` skill and pass it as `transport`.
