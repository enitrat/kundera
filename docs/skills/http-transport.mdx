title: "HTTP Transport"
description: "Advanced HTTP JSON-RPC transport with batching and retries."
---

This skill provides an HTTP transport with batching and retry support.
Copy it into your project when you need more than the primitive transport.

## Quick Start

```bash
cp -r examples/skills/http-transport src/skills/
```

## Usage

```ts
import { httpTransport } from './skills/http-transport';

const transport = httpTransport('https://starknet-mainnet.public.blastapi.io', {
  batch: { batchWait: 10, batchSize: 50 },
  retries: 3,
  timeout: 30000,
});
```

## Notes

- `batch` enables auto-batching for concurrent requests.
- `retries` uses exponential backoff (`retryDelay * 2^attempt`).
